# Crayon
MET CS601 - Web Application Development - Final Project<br>
Boston University - Spring 2015

A website that sells crayons implemented in HTML5, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, and PHP and connects to a MySQL database. It dynamically displays the stock of crayons and manages a shopping cart via database connection. The goal of this project was to focus on aesthetic user interface design and aid in learning the basics of full stack development.
